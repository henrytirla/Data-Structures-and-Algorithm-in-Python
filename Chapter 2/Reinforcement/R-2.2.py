"""Give an example of a software application in which adaptability can mean
the difference between a prolonged lifetime of sales and bankruptcy."""



"""

eg Microsoft word , Facebook

Let's take Facebook as an example, when it was started it's was just a small application providing 
service around the university campus, maintaining one server. Now it's a major platform 
providing service for the billions of people around the globe.
the software adapts over time with new requirements to meet the needs of people

 

Take any major software application, it adapts over time with new needs. 
They wouldn't have sustained in the market if not for the adaptability.
 

With the ever-growing data and rapid technology growth, 
the inability to adopt new requirements means bankruptcy.
