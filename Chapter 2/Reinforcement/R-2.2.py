eg Microsoft word , Facebook

One example of a software application in which adaptability can mean the difference between success and failure is a social media platform. 
In the constantly changing world of social media, new technologies and trends emerge regularly. 
If a social media platform is not able to adapt to these changes and offer new and innovative features to its users, 
it risks losing users to competitors who are able to offer a better user experience. 
This can ultimately lead to a decline in sales and even bankruptcy.
 On the other hand, a social media platform that is able to adapt to changes and continuously improve its user experience can maintain a loyal user base and sustain long-term success.
