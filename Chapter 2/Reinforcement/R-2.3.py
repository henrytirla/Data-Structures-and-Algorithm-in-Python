Describe a component from a text-editor GUI and the methods that it encapsulates.






One component from a text-editor GUI is the text editor itself, which allows the user to input and edit text.
This component would likely encapsulate methods for inserting and deleting text, selecting text, copying and pasting text,
 undoing and redoing actions, and formatting text (e.g. changing font size and color). It might also include methods for
 saving and loading files, and for searching and replacing text within the editor. These methods would provide a simple
  and intuitive interface for the user to edit and manipulate text within the text editor
